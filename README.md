## Welcome

This project is inspired from Hurricane Milton, when we saw on the news how the interstate was just a parking lot because of all the congestion we knew there had to be a better way for people to evacuate safely and effectively out of the Tampa area. Our premise is to design a Maximum Flow network to get as many people out of the tampa area as possible given a hurricane path, we have set up several nodes from the zipcodes within Tampa and used the current evacuation route roads as our edges. 

Our Zip Code Geoson Data contains several neighboring county zip codes while our evacuation roads only contain hillsborough county so if you remake the zip code centroids remove the following zip codes because they are in other counties
