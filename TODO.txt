TODO

In your process_geojson you know that it will print out a data frame with a "type" this type will represent the type of road you are driving on 

What the TYPE Column Represents:
Values (C, H, M, P):

These appear to represent different road or route types.
Common classifications might be:
C: County road
H: Highway
M: Main road
P: Peripheral or Primary road

This is important because each of these types of roads have different flows, which will affect our answer because if our point is maximum flow
it may be more reasonable to send a lot more on longer routes on highways instead of just shorter drives through county roads
